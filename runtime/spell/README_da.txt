                          Den store danske ordliste

The Comprehensive Danish Dictionary (DSDO) is a free spell-checking dictionary
for Danish published by Skåne Sjælland Linux User Group (SSLUG).  One thing
which makes this dictionary different from most other dictionaries is that it
basically is the result of a vote among the proof-readers.  The editorial
group has _not_ proof-read all the words in the dictionary, but guides the
proof-readers and keeps track of the overall status of the dictionary.
